# brainhack2021-templates-and-pet-metadata

This project exists as a repository to collect existing templates and examples of PET metadata. The ultimate goal of this
project is to converge on a 'standard' template for collecting metada (blood, radio ligand, etc) for use by researchers
to minimally organize their data.

This project is divided into two directories:
 
- `metadata_templates` existing and proposed templates
- `sample_metadata` existing (real enough) spreadsheet data
